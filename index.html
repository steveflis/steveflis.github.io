      <h1>About Flis Forest & Land</h1>
      <p>
        We at Flis Forest & Land, LLC are deeply committed to improving and restoring privately owned forests throughout Pennsylvania. With over 12 million acres of forestland—more than 70% of it privately owned—landowners are key players in conserving and enhancing our state’s ecological legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team brings decades of combined experience in sustainable forestry. With credentials including a Bachelor of Science in Forest Ecosystem Management from Penn State, ISA Arborist Certification, and a Pennsylvania Commercial Pesticide Applicator license, we pride ourselves on expert-level service rooted in science, stewardship, and strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in central PA, we’ve seen firsthand the devastating impact of forest mismanagement—low-value timber, poor regeneration, and degraded wildlife habitat. We exist to change that. Our mission is to help landowners unlock the full potential of their forestland—boosting timber value, improving biodiversity, and empowering better forest stewardship for generations to come.
