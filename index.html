      <h1>About Flis Forest & Land</h1>
      <p>
        At Flis Forest & Land, we’re passionate about helping private landowners throughout Central Pennsylvania realize the true value and potential of their woodlands. With over 12 million acres of forest in the state—more than 70% of it privately owned—we know that private stewardship is essential for long-term forest health.
      </p>
      <p>
        We bring expert insight backed by a Bachelor of Science in Forest Ecosystem Management from The Pennsylvania State University, ISA Certified Arborist credentials, and a Pennsylvania Commercial Pesticide Applicator license. Our specialties include timber evaluation, habitat planning, vegetation management, and practical, results-driven consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, we see forests left unmanaged or mismanaged, stripped of both value and biodiversity. We’re here to change that. Through education, actionable planning, and trusted on-the-ground service, we help landowners build healthier forests, enhance wildlife habitat, and maximize the sustainability and worth of their property for generations to come.
