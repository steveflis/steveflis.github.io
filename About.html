      <h1>About Flis Forest & Land</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Steve Flis, and I live in central Pennsylvania. I’ve always had a deep passion for improving forested areas, especially those owned by private landowners. Pennsylvania has over 12 million acres of forestland—more than 70% of which is privately owned—making private landowners key to forest health and sustainability in our state.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Science in Forest Ecosystem Management from The Pennsylvania State University and am an ISA Certified Arborist and a Certified Commercial Pesticide Applicator in Pennsylvania. My specialties include tree and herbaceous plant identification, timber appraisal, and wildlife habitat planning.

      <p>
        Growing up, I often witnessed how poorly managed local forests were—often stripped of value and ecological function. My mission is to change that. I want to give local landowners the tools, expertise, and support they need to increase the value of their timber, improve wildlife habitat, and become better forest stewards for the long-term benefit of their land and our environment.
